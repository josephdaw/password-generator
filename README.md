# Password Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
This is a basic website that allows a user to create a randomly generated password. The user has the ability to choose whether to include any combination of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters.

You can [view this site](https://josephdaw.github.io/password-generator/) on Github Pages at https://josephdaw.github.io/password-generator/

NOTE: This site does not use crypto quality randomness and therefore I would not recommend using this tool alone to generate passwords.

## Mock-Up
